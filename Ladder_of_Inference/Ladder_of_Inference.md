# The Ladder of Inference

The Ladder of Inference is a model of the steps we use to make sense of situations in order to act.
It is helpful for us to think about our thinking and coordinate our thinking with others.

## Available Data

Any directly observable data that surrounds us in our daily lives e.g.

- people's words
- tone of voice
- body movement
- newspaper articles
- statistical results from a marketing survey

## Select Data

Here’s the thing, though: It’s not often that we use all available reality and facts to make decisions.

We have the tendency to zero in on specific pieces of information, or perhaps even cherry pick certain pieces that better suit our preferences or agenda.

## Paraphrase Data

When the data we choose involves human contact, such as spoken language, written communication, or gesture. We translate what the individual is saying or doing into our own (unspoken) words. This paraphrase happens as we listen and is crucial to our understanding of what individuals are saying.
