# 5 Dysfunctions of a Team

"5 Dysfunctions of a Team" is created by Patrick Lencioni for teams to perform better together.
Like Maslow's "Hierachy of Needs" is takes a form of a pyramid which and the concept that you cannot resolve the issues of a higher level without attending to the lower level needs first.

Each dysfunction has a direct impact on a team’s performance and smaller overall productivity.

## #3 Dysfunction of a Team: Lack of Commitment

If the team members avoid open discussion of controversial topics and don’t clearly understand why this or that decision has been taken, they fail to commit to the adopted course of action or team goals overall.

### Teams that lack commitment…

- Lack confidence and are in fear of failure
- Discuss the same topics or decisions over and over again
- Make ambiguity and second-guessing thrive
- Fail to seize opportunity spending too much time on making a decision

### Solution for Lack of Commitment:

There are several strategies that might help you overcome this dysfunction of a team. First, make it a rule to summarise all key decisions made during the meeting and the rationale for taking them. 

If the meeting is with the managing staff, clarify what should and should not be communicated to a larger team.

### When you overcome this dysfunction, your team will…

- Clearly understand work directions and priorities
- Share common goals and objectives
- Be ready to change
- Not let the fear of mistake prevent it from moving forward
