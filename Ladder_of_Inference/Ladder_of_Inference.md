# The Ladder of Inference

The Ladder of Inference is a model of the steps we use to make sense of situations in order to act.
It is helpful for us to think about our thinking and coordinate our thinking with others.

## Available Data

Any directly observable data that surrounds us in our daily lives e.g.

- people's words
- tone of voice
- body movement
- newspaper articles
- statistical results from a marketing survey

## Select Data

Here’s the thing, though: It’s not often that we use all available reality and facts to make decisions.

We have the tendency to zero in on specific pieces of information, or perhaps even cherry pick certain pieces that better suit our preferences or agenda.

## Paraphrase Data

When the data we choose involves human contact, such as spoken language, written communication, or gesture. We translate what the individual is saying or doing into our own (unspoken) words. This paraphrase happens as we listen and is crucial to our understanding of what individuals are saying.

## Name And Explan/Evaluate What Is Happening And Decide What To Do

The paraphrased data is then used to characterize what is happening into a more general category. Then we explain why it is happening and if it is good or bad by using our stock of causal theories and our value system. Based on this evaluation we then draw our repertoire of actions and decide what to do.

## Reflexive Loop

Our assumptions, values, and beliefs influence how we select data. We act on the basis of our interpretations. So our ways of understanding and acting create a self-reinforcing system, insulating us from alternative ways of understanding.
