# The blind men and the elephant

## Summary
In the folk tale "The Blind Men and the Elephant", a group of blind men or men in complete darkness examine an elephant to understand what the animal is.
Each man examines a different part of the elephants body. Later they compare their examinations to each other and find out that everyone has a different point of view:

- The first man thinks it is a wall(elephants body).
- The second man thinks it is a spear(elephants tusk).
- The third man thinks it is a snake(elephants trunk).
- The fourth man thinks it is a tree(elephants knee).
- The fifth man thinks it is a fan(elephants ear).
- The sixth man thinks it is a rope(elephants tail).

-> The folk tale shows that reality can be understood differently depending on the perspective.

## Origin (Jonas)

## Moral / what we can learn 
- The "elephant" in this story can stand for all kinds of things that we cannot properly assess.
- We all have a limited or simply different perspective on these things through our previous experiences.
- With our senses we often can't assess or interpret all information correctly. So they often do not show the reality, but our estimation
- There is often not one perspective. Several or all perspectives, however different, can be correct.
- If we assume that only our perspective is correct, we find it difficult to work with others.
- But we can also make use of our diversity by uniting the different perspectives.
