#Iceberg Model


Iceberg model is a tool that allows you to shift your perspective and see beyond the immediate events 
that everyone notices. It helps you to uncover root causes of why those events happen. That's possible 
by looking at deeper levels of abstraction within the system that are not immediately obvious.

###1. The Event Level

The event level is the level at which we typically perceive the world—for instance, waking up 
one morning to find we have caught a cold. While problems observed at the event level can often be 
addressed with a simple readjustment, the iceberg model pushes us not to assume that every issue can 
be solved by simply treating the symptom.

###2. The Pattern Level

If we look just below the event level, we often notice patterns. Similar events have been taking place 
over time — we may have been catching more colds when we haven’t been resting enough. Observing patterns 
allows us to forecast and forestall events.

###3. The Structure Level

Below the pattern level lies the structure level. When we ask, “What is causing the pattern we are 
observing?” the answer is usually some kind of structure. Increased stress at work due to the new 
promotion policy, the habit of eating poorly when under stress, or the inconvenient location of healthy 
food sources could all be structures at play in our catching a cold.

###4. The Mental Model Level

Mental models are the attitudes, beliefs, morals, expectations, and values that allow structures to 
continue functioning as they are. These are the beliefs that we often learn subconsciously from our 
society or family and are likely unaware of. Mental models that could be involved in us catching a cold 
could include: a belief that career is deeply important to our identity, that healthy food is too 
expensive, or that rest is for the unmotivated.
