# People-Process-Technology

## General

The people, process, technology (PPT) framework is often used in software companies for information technology management because it helps to map the entire value streams of people, process and technology and thus can optimize operations and ships faster. Its generally about three elements and how they interact with each other.

## People

## Process

## Technology

Technology provides tools that can be used to implement the process. It is important to not always go for the newest shiny tool but for the one which suits your team and process best. So technology should always be the last decision, after everything else is clear.
