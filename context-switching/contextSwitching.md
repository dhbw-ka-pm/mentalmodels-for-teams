# Context Switching and Productivity

Context switching is part of many people's life nowadays. It describes
the state in which we are constantly toggling between news, alerts, emails, messages, 
tasks, apps, tabs, screens, etc. We explain you, why numerous people share this problem 
and how you can deal with it and start working more focused. 

## What is context switching? 

The expression originally comes from computing and describes how operating systems
can handle multiple processes. When humans try to imitate that, 
they will notice that it cuts short on our time and focus.

```
When switching contexts,each component of what we are doing
(screens, tasks, programs) becomes a fragment of our attention.
```

Example: You are writing a report and get an email from your boss.
You click on the mail and read it quickly. It is not a big task, something
that you can do at the end of the week. You switch back to your report.
Part of your attention still sticks to the mail. This is called 

**attention residue**.

Like this you pay an **attention tax**, meaning lost time and productivity.

Sophia LeRoy describes this as follows:

“People experiencing attention residue after switching tasks are likely to demonstrate poor performance on that next task. The thicker the residue, the worse the performance.”

# Strategies to prevent context switching:

### Bullet Point List
Thinking about another task splits your concentration and makes it harder to focus on what’s in front of you at the moment.

### Prioritize tasks
Deciding what to do and what to do next can become its own distraction.
You can decide what to focus on with the Eisenhower decision matrix for example.

### Structure your day
Choose a method like “time blocking” or the “Pomodoro method” to stay focused

### Screen-free breaks
When you step back from your computer, you give your brain a chance to refresh and recharge

### Develop awareness of distraction
To break a habit is to become aware that you’re doing it and to protocol it. Simply noting a distraction makes the unconscious conscious.

### Eliminate distractions
Keep distracting media closed and muted, when you concentrate on work.

### De-clutter and streamline your digital life
Centralize your tasks and apps into a task manager app like [Todoist](https://todoist.com/).

### Resist the urge to respond right away
Limit yourself to how many times you check email.

### Promote thoughtful communication
Do your part to minimize the context switching others have to do. Be thoughtful about how often you send an email or chat.
