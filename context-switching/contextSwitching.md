# Strategies to prevent context switching:

### Bullet Point List
Thinking about another task splits your concentration and makes it harder to focus on what’s in front of you at the moment.

### Prioritize tasks
deciding what to do and what to do next can become its own distraction.
You can decide what to focus on with the Eisenhower decision matrix for example.

### structure your day
Choose a method like “time blocking” or the “Pomodoro method” to stay focused

### screen-free breaks
when you step back from your computer, you give your brain a chance to refresh and recharge
