# 5 Dysfunctions of a Team

"5 Dysfunctions of a Team" is created by Patrick Lencioni for teams to perform better together.
Like Maslow's "Hierachy of Needs" is takes a form of a pyramid which and the concept that you cannot resolve the issues of a higher level without attending to the lower level needs first.

Each dysfunction has a direct impact on a team’s performance and smaller overall productivity.

## #2 Daysfunction of a Team: Fear of Conflict

You can't benefit from workplace diversity if opsing ideas are held back for fear of conflict.

### Teams that fear conflict…

- Hesitate to voice opinions and concerns
- Ignore controversial topics even if they have potential to determine team’s success
- Have more interpersonal conflicts and personal attacks
- Have backchannel communication and politics

### Solution for Fear of Conflict

You can test for this problem by bringing up a bad idea and see if it will be accepted or not.
To solve the problem you can assign "a devil's advvocate" who will try to find faults in any sugestion and the other team members have to defend their ideas. This will show the team that voicing oposing ideas is good.

### Overcoming the fear of conflict in your team, you will get a team that…

- Leverages diversity and exploits the ideas of everyone on the team
- Quickly solves the problems
- Openly discusses critical topics and concerns
- Minimizes politics

## #3 Dysfunction of a Team: Lack of Commitment

If the team members avoid open discussion of controversial topics and don’t clearly understand why this or that decision has been taken, they fail to commit to the adopted course of action or team goals overall.

### Teams that lack commitment…

- Lack confidence and are in fear of failure
- Discuss the same topics or decisions over and over again
- Make ambiguity and second-guessing thrive
- Fail to seize opportunity spending too much time on making a decision

### Solution for Lack of Commitment

There are several strategies that might help you overcome this dysfunction of a team. First, make it a rule to summarise all key decisions made during the meeting and the rationale for taking them. 

If the meeting is with the managing staff, clarify what should and should not be communicated to a larger team.

### When you overcome this dysfunction, your team will…

- Clearly understand work directions and priorities
- Share common goals and objectives
- Be ready to change
- Not let the fear of mistake prevent it from moving forward
