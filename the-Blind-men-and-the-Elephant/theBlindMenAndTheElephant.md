# The blind men and the elephant

## Summary (Willi)
-> mit Bild (Julien)

## Origin (Jonas)

## Moral / what we can learn 
- The "elephant" in this story can stand for all kinds of things that we cannot properly assess.
- We all have a limited or simply different perspective on these things through our previous experiences.
- With our senses we often can't assess or interpret all information correctly. So they often do not show the reality, but our estimation
- There is often not one perspective. Several or all perspectives, however different, can be correct.
- If we assume that only our perspective is correct, we find it difficult to work with others.
- But we can also make use of our diversity by uniting the different perspectives.
